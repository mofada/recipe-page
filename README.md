### Question 
#### 1. question one
There is a small flaw. I used the native table to implement the Nutrition at the bottom. The field on the left has no padding.
1. I tried to add padding-left, but it caused the field on the right to move.
2. Add padding-left to the field on the left, and then set the width, but fixed width will have problems on mobile.
   So is there any other better way?

### 2. question two
I still have some doubts about responsive design. In tailwindcss, I can use the md: tag to operate responsiveness. I donâ€™t quite understand whether this means that the mobile terminal should be used first?

For example, the cover: h-[200px] md:h-[300px] at the top, the mobile terminal or the default is 200px, and the PC terminal or when the width exceeds 768px uses 300px
